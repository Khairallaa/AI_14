Pong Game Description

Overview:
The Pong Game is a classic two-player arcade game implemented using Python and Pygame. It is a simple yet engaging game that replicates the nostalgic experience of the original Pong game, where players control paddles to hit a bouncing ball back and forth across the screen.

Features:
- Two-Player Mode**: Players can compete against each other, controlling paddles on opposite sides of the screen.
- Ball Dynamics**: The ball moves at a constant speed, bouncing off the top and bottom edges of the screen, as well as the paddles.
- Scoring System**: Players score points when the opposing player fails to return the ball. The game resets the ball's position when it goes out of bounds.
- Responsive Controls**: Players can move their paddles up and down using the keyboard for an intuitive gameplay experience.

Controls:
- Player 1: Use the `W` key to move the left paddle up and the `S` key to move it down.
- Player 2: Use the `UP` arrow key to move the right paddle up and the `DOWN` arrow key to move it down.

**Technical Details:**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Library Used**: Pygame, a popular library for game development in Python.
- **Game Window**: The game runs in a window with a defined width and height, and features a black background with white paddles and a ball.

**Installation Instructions:**
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
2. Install Pygame using the command: `pip install pygame`.
3. Copy the provided Pong game code into a Python file (e.g., `pong_game.py`).
4. Run the script using the command: `python pong_game.py`.

**Conclusion:**
The Pong Game serves as an excellent introduction to game development with Python and Pygame, demonstrating fundamental concepts such as game loops, collision detection, and user input handling. It can be further enhanced with additional features such as sound effects, power-ups, and a more complex scoring system.
